the Permute Squeeze-and-Excitation (PSE) module is designed to independently capture information along the channel (c), height (h) and width (w) dimensions using an innovative attention mechanism, thereby enhancing the network's “Structural Contextual Awareness”, which refers to the discernment and interpretation of structural nuances within medical images, ensuring a more profound understanding and representation of the underlying anatomical and pathological features.
